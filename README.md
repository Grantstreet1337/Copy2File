# Copy2File
A simple bash script to simplify opening marked text in the terminal to an text-editor.

Purpose:
Copy2File is a basic bash script that enables you to mark your text in the terminal and open it in a textfile in a chosen editor of your choice. This script removes the additional steps with copy pasting, creating file etc. So, basically, with that being said I can open a marked text in the terminal by clicking one keyboard shortcut and it automatically prints the text within the textfile and also gives it a predetermined name.

I recommend binding this script to a keyboard shortcut for effiency. If not, you can mark text and type ```./copy2file```
